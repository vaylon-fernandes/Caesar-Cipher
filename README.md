# Caesar-Cipher
Python implementation of the caesar cipher

### What is Caesar cipher? <br> 
A Caesar cipher is a type of substitution cipher in which all letter in the plain text are replaced by a letter at a predetermined shift further along the alphabet.
For e.g. In the Image below we can observe a caesar cipher with a right shift of 3 i.e. a, the letter at postion 0, gets shifted to d, the letter at the 3rd position, b->e, c->f 
and so on.
